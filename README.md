# MovieViewer
A simple app to voting for Star Wars movies. The main requirement was to code it within 1 hours, so plenty of staff were implemented badly:
- form validation wasn't implemented, so user can submit a form without passing value (it will be 0),
- lack of commit history,
- a better project structure could be done,
- EF queries could be better (AsNoTracking, selecting only desired columns),
- the layout is poor.

Normally I wouldn't make an app using .NET Core MVC, because I think it is obsolete. Nowadays usage of Web API with Single Page Application technology is a desired thing.
